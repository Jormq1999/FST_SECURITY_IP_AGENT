# FST_SECURITY_IP_AGENT — VAL Security IP Agent
===========================================

> _A Validation Security IP Agent for **CSME** (Converged Security and Manageability Engine) designed for seamless validation and design collaboration._

This repository hosts a specialized agent and its supporting documentation, tailored to enhance the verification process of critical security IPs.

---

### Purpose
-------

The primary goal is to provide an in-repo validation assistant for CSME sub-IPs such as `OCS`, `Gasket`, and `HECI`. This agent is designed to:

- Act as a **senior validation advisor**, embodying a persona with deep expertise in `UVM/OVM`, `SVA`, and formal verification.
- Utilize repository documentation, including `CSME_Overview.md` and `agent/VALIDATION_AGENT_PERSONA.md`, as its canonical context.
- Assist both _junior_ and _senior_ validators with:
  - Verification Plans
  - Assertions
  - UVM Sequences
  - Debugging Checklists
  - Ramp-up Guides

### Key files
---------

- **`CSME_Overview.md`**: An essential architecture-level overview of CSME, its major sub-IPs, their interactions, and key design notes. <ins>This should be your primary context for all architectural and verification mapping tasks.</ins>
- **`agent/VALIDATION_AGENT_PERSONA.md`**: Defines the persona of the validation agent (in Spanish), detailing its tone, skills, and expected outputs.
- **`.github/chatmodes/VAL_SECURITY_IP_AGENT.chatmode.md`**: The chat-mode configuration that instructs the agent to load its persona and the `CSME_Overview.md` upon startup.

### How to use (for validators)
---------------------------

1.  Open the repository in your editor and thoroughly review `CSME_Overview.md` to grasp the high-level architecture.
2.  Initiate a chat session with the **VAL Security IP Agent** using the `VAL_SECURITY_IP_AGENT` chat mode.
3.  Make concrete requests. For example:
    - _"Create SVA assertions to validate DMA descriptor safety in the OCS."_
    - _"Draft a UVM test plan for Gasket's access-control registers."_
    - _"Generate a 30/60/90 ramp-up plan for a new validator."_
4.  If you need information on register-level or internal documentation not present here, please request access through official channels. The agent will provide conceptual examples in such cases.

### How to use (for designers)
--------------------------

- Validate your design intent by requesting **formal properties**, **coverage goals**, and **test scenarios**.
- Provide interface descriptions or non-confidential RTL snippets to receive targeted assertions and UVM sequences.

### Agent behavior & safety
-----------------------

- The agent strictly adopts the persona from `agent/VALIDATION_AGENT_PERSONA.md` and relies on `CSME_Overview.md` for technical context.
- It will **never** request or reveal secrets or PII. Any requests for restricted content will be met with high-level guidance and a refusal to share sensitive details.

### Contributing
------------

- Keep the `CSME_Overview.md` and persona files updated to ensure context accuracy.
- If you extend the agent's behavior, remember to update `.github/chatmodes/VAL_SECURITY_IP_AGENT.chatmode.md` accordingly.

### Next steps and ideas
--------------------

- Populate an `examples/` directory with sample **UVM sequences** and **SVA assertions**.
- Develop automated validation scripts for quick lint and assertion checks on example RTL.
- Integrate diagrams (<sup>SVG</sup>) to visualize fabrics and data flows.
